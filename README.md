### Wax on, Wax off

This repository contains the source code written to develop the basic pages for the [Treviso Scala Group](http://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Treviso-Scala-Group/) workshop series website.

It is available [here](http://waxonwaxoff.stamplayapp.com)

---

The implementation is a quick and dirty static site, hosted on [Stamplay](http://stamplay.com) BAAS.

To run the website locally it is required to:

1. download the Bower dependencies;
2. compile the jade templates.

Please, if you like to enhance it do not hesitate to fork and PR! Meanwhile... enjoy it!
